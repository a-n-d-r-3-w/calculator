## Architectural Design ##

### Architectural Design Description ###
[Provide a link to an existing MathWorks architectural design document if this project leverages a documented design.  Otherwise, this template is for designing new (or undocumented) architecture.  If this project enhances existing architecture, use the template to describe the delta.]

[Describe the architecture details in the sections below.  In those sections  include or link to relevant architecture diagrams, examples include:
* Class diagrams
* Object diagrams
* Sequence diagrams
* Flow charts
* Call graphs
* State charts
* Doxygen
* Other]

#### Overview ####

The architectural design considerations include testability and extensibility. For example, developers should be able to
easily add and test new operations, or add and test new views that use the same model.

#### Distribution ####

#### Component/Module Design ####

#### Interface Design ####

#### Class Design ####

#### Algorithms ####

#### Data Structures ####

#### Use of existing components and libraries ####

#### Implementation language(s) selected ####

#### File and system organization ####

### Architectural Design Special Considerations ###

#### Testability ####

#### Third Party Dependencies ####

The architecture uses the Dojo Toolkit and QUnit.

#### Scalability and Performance ####

### Alternate Architectural Designs Considered ###
[Provide a list of alternate architectural designs considered and why they were rejected (e.g. cost/benefit analysis).]

## Open Issues ##
* [List any notable risks, constraints, assumptions, etc.]
